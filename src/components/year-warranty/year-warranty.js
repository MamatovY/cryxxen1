                        ZEN cards have a very neat feature that will help you

                        whenever your electronic devices start failing after the

                        standard warranty ends, which is pretty common.

                        When you buy any electronics with your ZEN shopping
                        MastercardÂ®, their warranty gets extended by one
                        year. How does it work? It simply does. Automatically.
