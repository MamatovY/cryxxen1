                It saves a little bit of money while you’re shopping, but in many cases it <br />
                takes ages to get anything out of it. We gave it a thought and made <br />
                cashback way more friendly. Up to 14% of what you spend using ZEN <br />
                Mastercard ® will materialize on your account right after the purchase. <br />
                It's like you haggled some cash, despite you didn't have to. Just don't <br />
                forget to use in-app cashback link.
